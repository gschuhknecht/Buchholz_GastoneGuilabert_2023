- Open the file ‘LIF_Simulation_Main_File.py’
- Go through the script and adjust the directory names where asked (all necessary changes are marked by ‘TODO’ comments)
- all other scripts are called from within this file

- in Part 1, all files are prepared that are necessary to run the simulations
	- follow all steps in Part 1 chronologically
In Part 2, the actual simulations are run and the resulting data are analyzed and plotted
	- follow the instructions and run one experiment at a time

- for questions regarding the code, please contact the corresponding author.
